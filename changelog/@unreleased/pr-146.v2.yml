    Go to hubble 2019-12-06-b8151d7

    hubble:
    - go to 2019-12-06-b8151d7 which allows filtering traffic based if it's reply or not
    - blacklist `reply: false` for dns traffic. reasoning is we want to see just dns-reply traffic in the success case and when it is a deny we want to see it at dns-request level
